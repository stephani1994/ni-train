<h1>Personal Information</h1>
<p>Stephanie Hobourn || S3952390  || S3952390@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
<p>I grew up in Shellharbour and moved to Sydney at 18 for more work opportunities. My mother is Thai and moved to Australia when she was 23. My biological father is Australian; however, I was brought up by my stepfather who is Maltese. I can’t speak either Thai or Maltese, but I very much grew up immersed in both cultures. I started my higher education journey in 2018, attempting to complete it part time, and took a break until 2020 where I picked up my degree at a full-time capacity. I’m on track to graduate May 2023, if I continue full time. </p>
<p>I hold a green belt in taekwondo, though I haven’t practiced since I was in high school. Since COVID hit in 2020, I’ve found a love for Yoga! I started with a free 30-day program on YouTube – Yoga with Adrienne. It helps keep me active, stretched, and grounded mentally. I would highly recommend to everyone!</p>

<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
<p>I am interested in this subject, mainly because I work in the Technology sector at Suncorp (as a Portfolio Advisor), I thought it is a great opportunity to gain a better understanding of what our Project Managers are doing! I'm really enjoying Portfolio however I would also love getting more experience on the delivery side!</p>
<p>To pinpoint the event that sparked my interest, would be when my previous executive manager reached out to me about a Business Analyst role opening within the technology department at Suncorp. Since moving across from the business into technology, I’ve really enjoyed and been fascinated by all the projects and understanding how fundamental it is to keep the business running!</p>
<p>I choose to come to RMIT as my Business degree (majoring in Management) is through Open Universities Australia. Since I’ve not completed all my core subjects, I wanted to use the opportunity of my electives to complete more technology focussed subjects!</p>
<p>I expect to learn over the course of completing these subjects that I will have a foundation on understanding technology better, and hopefully better understanding what aspects I enjoy and will want to learn more of.</p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p>https://careers.pageuppeople.com/346/ci/en/job/661126/program-manager-innovation</p>

</picture>
<p>This position is appealing due to the flexibility of the program! As the program manager, they would be the key stakeholder to provide oversight and management at a program level for all the projects within the Innovation program of work. I believe it would be really insightful to have this program view, to understand the dependencies, and also to prioritise projects within the program.</p>
<p>The requirements for the position would be strong project management experience, as being the program manager, you would need oversight and understanding of all the projects withing your program. Additionally, tertiary qualifications is listed as a requirement, however I believe with enough experience this may be overlooked.  Lastly the ad prescribes experience in Agile methodologies.</p>
<p>I plan to complete my degree, which will cover the requirement for tertiary qualification. I believe completing IT subjects as my electives will also be greatly beneficial. I also plan on taking up Business Analyst work again to gain more project delivery experience, and Project Management opportunities once I’m more comfortable with project delivery work. These two steps will build a strong foundation to apply for program management roles.</p>

<p>My results for the leadership style test is what I was expecting my leadership style to be should I become a leader. I currently find that strong collaboration finds the best solutions. Even though collaborating may take longer, the solution that is then implemented is usually the best outcome. These results  would not affect my behaviour within my team, as I currently work collaboratively with my leaders and peers, across multiple teams. When forming a team I would definitely take this into account, as I would want a team with a similar mindset and who enjoy collaboration particularly when problem solving.</p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

A mobile app that enables the user to scan ingredients, and the app can confirm whether it is vegan. Currently there’s apps for vegans where users can search a product, or scan a barcode, however there’s currently no app that can identify ingredients, particularly certain chemicals and food colourings to confirm if it is vegan.
Motivation
Veganism is growing in popularity, and most vegans can confirm at a quick glance of an ingredients list if a product is plant based. However, for new vegans, and in particular for certain chemicals and food colourings, even for experienced vegans it is hard to identity. Australia's vegan food market is projected to be the third-fastest-growing vegan market in the world with a growth rate of 9.6 percent, according to Statista.
<h2>Description </h2>
<p>The application (app) will be designed to be intuitive and simple. When opening the app, it will open the camera within the app which will allow the user to scan text immediately. After the camera recognises and scans ingredients, then it will convert the ingredients onto another interface which will highlight in GREEN, RED, or AMBER the ingredients that it has scanned:
<p>-	The GREEN means that the ingredients is vegan friendly. An example would be potatoes, which is not derived from animals.</p>
<p>-	RED indicates it is not vegan. The user can then click on the any RED (non-vegan) ingredients, which will then provide more information as to why the ingredient is not vegan; where the ingredients were derived from. An example of this would be red dye #40, which is red food colouring that’s been derived from beetles.</p>
<p>-	Lastly, some ingredients can return AMBER which is products that can be vegan, depending on that person’s perspective. One example of this may be a person that still chooses to consume oysters, as oysters do not have any pain receptors and are not a sentient being. Another example would be palm oil, which does not contain animal product, however, usually contributes to de-forestation and misplaces orangutangs. In these instances, with an AMBER highlight, there’ll be further information on why it is not clear, allowing the user to make their own informed decision. </p>
<p>Users can also click on the ‘photo album’, which will be accessed as a square on the bottom left of the camera screen to use a picture from their photo album, which can include a picture previously taken from a menu or product, or text of a screenshot of ingredients from their phone. </p>
Other than the main feature to scan ingredients, the app will have an additional user input option. This is to copy and paste text into an ingredient checker, which will provide the same output as the application scanner. This provides users the option to either check an ingredient list, or to check a single ingredient. </p>
<h2>Tools and Technologies </h2>
<p>The application would be available for IOS and Android. For IOS, Swift programming language would be used. Swift allows for development of the app with outputs being able to be viewed real time. Swift code would then also work for iPadOS, which would allow the app to be available for iPhones & iPads. For Android users, the application would also need to be created in Kotlin, which is the recommended developer for building Android apps. Kotlin is also allows outputs to be previewed real time. </p>
<h2>Skills Required </h2>
<p>Skills required to build the application on its own would be an experienced programmer. However, to ensure success of the program, a Business Analyst type role would be required to AB test potential interfaces to ensure the app is intuitive. Additionally, marketing and market segmentation would be required. It would be very feasible to set up a project team to set up this project, to ensure more success more research would be required and testing post prototype build. </p>
<h2>Outcome </h2>
<p>This application would be well known amongst the vegan community, making it easy identify whether a food item is ethical. Currently the app store has an app that users can scan a barcode for, however there’s a gap for ingredients scanner. A vegan diet has a positive environmental impact, as well as ethically reducing harm towards beings.</p>
